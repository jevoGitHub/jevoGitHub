<p>
 Since childhood, I have had a passion for creating and discovering how things work. From building elaborate stories and tales to later pursuing a college degree in interactive media design, I felt a strong desire to create. However, this was not enough, I felt the need to understand the back-end processes of what drives people and society. This led me to switch to entrepreneurship and business and pursued a degree in operations management 
</p>
<p>
Yet, I still felt something was missing. With time, I finally came to realize what I had longed for that passion to transport people away from mundane life and create new possibilities for them. This led to my journey into software engineering, which became my life's purpose and story. The story of pursuing passion and purpose and making everyone's ambition along with my own, a reality. This then begs the question, what part of this journey will you be a part of?
